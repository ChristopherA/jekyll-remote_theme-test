*"The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets."*

Our goals:

1. Raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary analyses.
2. Prepare for newer custody technologies that break older models for custodianship.

We are coordinating a series of workshops and inviting key ecosystem participants to share and learn the latest in technical and regulatory custody considerations.

## First Workshop: Simple Cold Storage & Self-Custody

Our first #SmartCustody workshop will be on Tue, January 29, 2019, 10:00 AM – 4:00 PM PST, at the Offices of Blockstream Corporation, 554 San Antonio Road, Palo Alto, CA 94040, [Map](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/smartcustody-simple-cold-storage-self-custody-workshop-tickets-54426618481#map-target).

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ChristopherA/test-github-page-themes/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Markdown

Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
